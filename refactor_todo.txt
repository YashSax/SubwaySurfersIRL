Refactor goals:

Input -> any video stream

PlayerDetector -> takes in the frame and returns the position of the player
ActionExecutor -> takes in the position of the player and executes the swipe

Should be able to run just the detection or both detection + action execution

Don't really care about the output being saved to a video file. Just streaming to the screen is good enough.

Want a unified interface for inputting live video vs. mp4
